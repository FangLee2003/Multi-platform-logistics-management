# 📱 FastRoute Logistics Driver Mobile App 2025

**FastRoute** is a mobile application for delivery drivers, developed with Flutter and featuring a modern **Spatial UI**. Built on **Clean Architecture** principles, the app is easy to maintain, extend, and test, with clear separation between UI, business logic, and data layers.

## ⚡ Quick Start Guide for Testers

Follow these steps to quickly test the app with a local backend:

### 1. Setup Environment
- Ensure your phone and computer are connected to the **same WiFi network**
- Download the latest APK from [this](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xaxwYYIBaBgO1-hCYK8MLx2tlR_SYVew?usp=sharing).

### 2. Find Computer's IP Address
- On the computer running the backend, open Command Prompt/PowerShell
- Run `ipconfig` and look for the IPv4 address (e.g., 192.168.1.5)
- Note this IP address as you'll need it for configuration

### 3. Start Backend Server
```bash
cd PROJECT_KTC_2025/spring-project
./gradlew bootRun
```
- Wait until you see "Started Application" message

### 4. Install and Configure the App
- Install the APK on your Android device
- Launch the app
- Select "Test Environment"
- Enter the API URL: `http://[YOUR_COMPUTER_IP]:8080/api` (e.g., `http://192.168.1.5:8080/api`)
- Save the configuration

### 5. Test the App
- Use the test credentials:
  - Email: `driver@gmail.com`
  - Password: `123456`
- Verify basic features work correctly:
  - Dashboard loads with test data
  - Map displays correctly
  - Delivery list shows test orders
  - Driver can update delivery status

### 6. Troubleshooting

- If login fails, ensure the backend is running and IP is correct
- Check if the device can reach the backend by opening `http://[YOUR_COMPUTER_IP]:8080/actuator/health` in the phone browser
- If connection fails, try using port forwarding with: `adb reverse tcp:8080 tcp:8080`
- If needed, disable firewall or add exception for port 8080
